    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, fastai has been hard at work improving and overhauling [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a literate programming environment for python.  A key feature of nbdev is automated generation of documentation from Jupyter notebooks.  This documentation system adds many niceties, such as the following types of hyperlinks automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Links to source code on GitHub.\n",
    " - Links to both internal and external documentation by introspecting variable names in backticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because documentation is so easy to create and maintain in nbdev, we find ourselves and others creating much more of it!  In addition to automatic hyperlinks, we often include our own links to relevant websites, blogs and videos when documenting code.  For example, one of the largest nbdev generated sites, [docs.fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/), has more than 300 external and internal links at the time of this writing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the continued popularity of [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and the growth of new nbdev projects, grooming these links manually became quite tedious.  We investigated solutions that could verify links for us automatically, but were not satisfied with any existing solutions.  These are the features we desired:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A platform independent solution that is not tied to a specific static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo.\n",
    "- Intelligent introspection of external links that are actually internal links.  For example, if we are building the site docs.fast.ai, a link to `https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial` should not result in a web request, but rather introspection of the local file system for the presence of `tutorial.html` in the right location.\n",
    "- Verification of any links to assets like CSS, data, javascript or other files. \n",
    "- Logs that are well organized that allow us to see each broken link or reference to a non-existent path, and the pages these are found in.\n",
    "- Parallelism to verify links as fast as possible. \n",
    "- Lightweight, easy to install with minimal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried tools such as [linkchecker](https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker) and [pylinkvalidator](https://github.com/bartdag/pylinkvalidator), but these required your site to be first be hosted. Since we wanted to check links on a static site, hosting is overhead we wanted to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what led us to create [fastlinkcheck](https://fastlinkcheck.fast.ai/), which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: For Ruby users, [htmlproofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) apperas to provide overlapping functionality.  We have not tried this library. "
